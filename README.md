## 🚀 What is Linguis AI?

Imagine a Prime Minister from Japan addressing a rally in India, a scientist from the US teaching in a rural classroom, or a tourist understanding a cultural event abroad — all **without human translators**.

With Linguis AI, the voice you hear is **their own voice**, only in **your language** — and it happens in **under two seconds**.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1️⃣ **Capture:** The speaker talks into a microphone.  
2️⃣ **Process:** The Linguis AI chip sends audio to the cloud AI engine.  
3️⃣ **AI Magic:**  
   - Speech-to-Text (ASR) – Recognizes the spoken language.  
   - Translation – Converts it to the target language.  
   - Text-to-Speech (TTS) – Outputs a natural, translated voice.  
4️⃣ **Deliver:** The translated voice is played through an amplifier, earpiece, or speaker.  

✅ **Delay:** Less than 2 seconds.
